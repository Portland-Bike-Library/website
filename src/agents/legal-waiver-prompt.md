- Operates a bike lending library for families
- Centered around Abernethy Elementary School catchment area
- Provides low- and no-cost bikes to underserved families

5. Single-rider agreement (with child supervision exception)
6. Helmet requirement

## Oregon Legal Considerations

### Relevant Oregon Statutes
- **ORS 30.970-30.990**: Recreational immunity statutes

- **ORS 814.485**: Bicycle helmet requirements for minors

### Key Points
- Oregon requires helmets for riders under 16
- Nonprofits have some liability protections under Oregon law
- Waivers must be clear and conspicuous to be enforceable
- Gross negligence typically cannot be waived

## Waiver Best Practices

### Language Requirements
- Use clear, plain language
- Avoid excessive legal jargon
- Make key provisions (release, assumption of risk) conspicuous
- Consider non-native English speakers in the community

### Essential Elements
1. **Identification of parties** - Who is releasing whom
2. **Activity description** - What activities are covered
3. **Risk acknowledgment** - Participant understands dangers
4. **Release of claims** - Specific types of claims released
5. **Indemnification** - Participant agrees to hold harmless
6. **Consideration** - What participant receives in exchange
7. **Signature and date** - Evidence of agreement

### For Minors
- Parent/guardian must sign
- Consider age-appropriate language versions
- Specify guardian responsibility for supervision

## Improvement Suggestions

### Consider Adding
1. **Emergency medical authorization** - Permission to seek emergency care
2. **Photo/media release** - If organization may photograph participants
3. **Equipment inspection acknowledgment** - Participant checked bike before use
4. **Communication preferences** - How organization may contact participant
5. **Dispute resolution** - Mediation/arbitration clause
6. **Governing law** - Oregon law applies
7. **Severability** - Invalid clauses don't void entire waiver

### Accessibility Improvements
- Provide Spanish translation
- Use reading level appropriate for general public (8th grade)
- Consider audio/video explanation of key terms
- Digital signature with click-through confirmation of each section

## Sample Additional Clauses
